obstacle_range: 2.5
#This is used for the obstacles
#If the robot detects an obstacle closer than 2.5 meters in our case, it will put the obstacle in the costmap

raytrace_range: 3.0
#This is used to clean/clear the costmap and update the free space in it when the robot moves

footprint: [[-0.2,-0.2],[-0.2,0.2], [0.2, 0.2], [0.2,-0.2]]
# This is used to indicate the geometry of the robot to the navigation stack


#robot_radius: ir_of_robot
inflation_radius: 0.5
#This value given to keep a minimal distance between the geometry of the robot and the obstacles

cost_scaling_factor: 10.0
#This modifes the behavior of the robot around the obstacles.(aggressive or conservative)


observation_sources: scan
# This set the sensors used by the navigation stack to get the data from the real world and calculate the path.
